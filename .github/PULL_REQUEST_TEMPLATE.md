Thank you for contributing! Please take a moment to review our [**contributing guidelines**](https://github.com/unityinfluence/catalog-admin/tree/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to make the process easy and effective for everyone involved.

*Please open an issue* before embarking on any significant pull request, especially those that
add a new library or change existing tests, otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working
on something that might not end up being merged into the project.

Before opening a pull request, please ensure:

- [ ] The code compiles
- [ ] The code honors the acceptance criteria of the story
- [ ] The code follows coding conventions of the product team
- [ ] The code has been developer-tested and includes unit tests
- [ ] The code includes code documentation like javastringdoc where appropriate
- [ ] The code is tidy (short methods, indentation, no commented-out code, no spelling mistakes etc)
- [ ] The code doesn’t have any hardcoded, development only things still in the code
- [ ] The code releases all resources (DB connection, files, etc)
- [ ] I have considered proper use of exceptions
- [ ] I have made appropriate use of logging
- [ ] I’ve followed SOLID principles
- [ ] I’ve considered the performance of the code
- [ ] I’ve considered all security aspects
- [ ] I’ve considered flexibility so that code implementations can be swapped with a better one
- [ ] I’ve considered use of open source libraries

Be kind to code reviewers, please try to keep pull requests as small and focused as possible :)
